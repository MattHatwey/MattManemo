❄️About my own characters❄️
I want to show my characters to everyone!
This is the story!    Matt's story part1.                            There was a land named Manemo land.
One day a manemo was born in the middle of the 1st war of Manemo land.
But if a Manemo is born in the middle of the war, that Manemo will get the power to do the same thing as the winner of the war . Matt, that Manemo who was born in the middle of the war got the power to be evil, and a prophecy named after it had a very important part that was very good so all the Manemos in that land always would use it. Everyone would use it, but Matt.
Because he had the power to become evil, he couldn't use it.
He met friends, friends that are not scared of him, friends that could forgive him, best friends forever.
Then, when he got good friends, one friend said, ``Where and how did you live when you were born?” asked a friend of his. I don't know”. Said Matt.
Maybe we could go ask the king”. Said one Manemo from near.
What prophecy?” asked Matt, looking confused.
You don’t know? Said all the Manemos that were around him.
It was made when you were born.” said one frinend.
That afternoon Matt went to the castle and said to the king, what's that prophecy that was made when I was born.’’asked Matt.
The king said to him, ``You were alone when you were born,”  you have to ask your friends.”said the king.
Ok.” said Matt.
He asked his friends, who won the battle in the 1st war?”said Matt.
The evilness.” said one of his friends.
I was born that day,”I can’t use it,'' said Matt.
Why?” asked one friend.
Because I have the power to be evil.”said Matt


The end of Matt story part 1.

 
 
Once his friends knew what happened the frinend said that “a Manemo was actually good but the power changed some things up”. But still who will solve the mystery? 
Almost all Manemos were scared of Evilness and the battle.
But one day, Matt found out the friends did not like him after all.
“Why” he thought as he was walking.
When he was 6 years old, his friends were nice but when he was 8 years old, his friends did not really play with him.
But he always was older than his friends, 3 years older.
He lay down always and he kept on having a dream of the egg he found in the middle of the war and was with the egg and then he found out that the egg was neer and when he put it in the forest somewhere.
Then he knew exactly where it was.
 He found the egg.
Finally, said Matt, looking around to see no one.
He lay with the egg and until 6 years later a little crack was getting bigger and then he said to the egg “ Have       fun with me” and he saw the Manemo.
They were together until he noticed that the king and queen were looking at him.
But he felt safe.
He rang the bell and the king and queen saw him.
